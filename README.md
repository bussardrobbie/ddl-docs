# ddl-docs
A last-ditch effort to save the remaining knowledge from DDL's repositories and add it to the collective knowledge of the community in an open-source format.

Once combed through to remove extraneous formatting and code (and cleaned up for accuracy purposes or with updated information), these articles will be hosted on a community wiki open to editing and contribution.

TODO:
1. Finish the wiki setup and purchase a domain for it.
2. Download and comb through AWS-stored content hosted by Help Scout, to preserve pictures, videos, and graphics.
3. Find some moderately clean way to store that content alongside these articles (will likely require new folders being created for each article with the content).
4. Remove extraneous HTML code from each article and clean up formatting for presentation into the wiki.
5. Mirror each article on the wiki.
6. Close this repository as it will be redundant once the wiki is stood up.

If we can, we need to find a way to get the public stuff off of the [OSKR Support Knowledge Base](https://oskr.ddl.io) as well, but the route is down.
